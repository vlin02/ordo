You are building a game-accurate engine visualizer, and LLM framework for minecraft 1.21

packages/engine
The engine is to faithfully and concisely implement the spec found in spec.md
We are not optimizing for efficiency but rather simplicity and conciseness with reasonable performance

src/engine.test.ts
happy path should cover large swathts of spec.md while keeping the scenario simple
add additional tests for edge cases as NECESSARY. Aim to get coverage of the remaining logic in spec.md not covered by the happy path WHILE minimizing the number and complexity of these additional tests

keywords:
productionize - evaluate adherence + coverage of tests and impl of engine against the spec.md
cleanup <symbol> - evaluate and any obvious ways to simplify, redundant logic, extract without coupling (only suggest don't execute)
